   - Stat scaling with defending stat lower than 4 freezes the game via division by 0
   - Dual-type effectiveness can show wrong text and sound
   - Level-up moves not learned when a Pokémon grows by two or more levels at once
   - Item evolutions can be triggered by Pokémon with matching IDs battling last
   - Blaine may use a Super Potion with his Pokémon at full health
